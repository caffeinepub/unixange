  "summary": "The diff implements system-based dark/light mode theme switching across the frontend. REQ-1 (CSS variables under .dark selector in index.css) and REQ-2 (ThemeProvider in App.tsx) are fully implemented. REQ-3 is largely implemented via CSS custom property tokens used throughout all listed components. However, tailwind.config.js is omitted from the diff due to size limits, so the darkMode: 'class' configuration cannot be verified.",

      "reason": "frontend/tailwind.config.js was listed as omitted from the diff due to limits. The acceptance criterion that tailwind.config.js has darkMode set to 'class' cannot be confirmed from available evidence.",
