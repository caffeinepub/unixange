  "summary": "Implemented a new guarded actor-initialization hook with timeout + raw error logging, added IC stopped-canister error detection/parsing, and updated error sanitization and the error screen to display more user-friendly messages (including canister ID when available). Also refactored query hooks to use the guard. Diff summary indicates additional unrelated UI/routes/styling changes beyond the BuildRequest.",

      "description": "Added/modified multiple unrelated UI/UX and marketplace styling changes (new routes/pages, OLX-inspired design tokens, header/footer redesign, various marketplace component changes) not requested by the BuildRequest.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses only on stopped-canister error UX, error sanitization, createActor warning removal, and preventing duplicate access-control initialization; it explicitly does not request new pages/routes or broad UI restyling.",
